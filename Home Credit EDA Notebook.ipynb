    "# SUMMARY OF EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS \n",
    "\n",
    "DATA SUMMARY: This project constitutes 6 datasets in csv format namely, application_{train|test}.csv which is the main dataset, which has an active relation to the datasets previous_application.csv and bureau.csv with the SK_ID_CURR column. This column in the main dataset is unique and acts as an identifier for all loan applications. Bereau.csv dataset is further mapped one-to-one to bureau_balance.csv dataset with the SK_ID_BUREAU column and previous_application.csv is further mapped to 3 other datasets POS_CASH_balance.csv, installments_payments.csv and credit_card_balance.csv with the column SK_ID_Prev and both these are active relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable in Home Credit default risk project is TARGET column in application_train.csv dataset containing binary values, 1 for clients with payment difficulties and 0 for all other situations. 91% of the total records have 0 while remaining 9% has 1 as TARGET value. Based on this column, the project attempts to identify which all clients are at higher risk of credit default. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the analysis the steps taken are to find the shapes of the dataframes, examining the first 5 rows each dataframe using the head() function, discovering common columns that each dataframe with each other, print the info for each of the dataframe variable objects, get summary statistics for each of the variables in teh dataframes, gather information about the categorical variables used in the dataframes, and printing lists of each of the unique value in the categorical variables of the data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the application.train dataset and application.test dataset contain missing values. Deciding whether to remove the rows that contain missing values, excluding certain variables, or imputing the missing values can potentionally have a high impact on the model's ability to predict the target variable accurately. Considering columns to imputed which are having missing value percentage above 40% is a good approach for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The projects' visualization displays most applicants are female and stand at nearly 60000 compared to male at 29000 and most clients are middle-aged as per the age distribution. Most applicants are living in apartments and most applicants are of occupation 'laborers'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the dataframes has an interesting way of interacting with one another that we can use to determine our target variable of whether the borrower is trustworthy or not within our training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After EDA, the next of the project will be to perform feature engineering, obtaining correlation between independent variables and modelling predictive algorithm using strongest predictors and target variable. \n",
